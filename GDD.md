# Project Codename: Chyrralon
*(Mutation & Evolution Digital CCG)*

---

## **Core Concept**
A digital collectible card game where players summon base creatures and guide their growth through **mutations** and **evolutions**.  
- Creatures start simple (e.g., a Grub).  
- Mutations add traits (e.g., Spikes → thorns damage, Carapace → armor).  
- Specific mutation combos trigger **Evolutions** into advanced creatures.  
- Procedural variation ensures no two evolved creatures are exactly the same.

## **Card Types**
1. **Base Creatures**  
   - Weak starting units.  
   - Contain **DNA slots** (Body, Attack, Defense, etc.) to accept mutations.  

2. **Mutation Cards**  
   - Attach permanently to creatures.  
   - Have **structured primary effects** (clear, predictable).  
   - Include **procedural modifiers** (randomized twists).  
   - Example: *Spikes* (+2 Attack, Thorns) with a chance to also gain *Toxic Spikes*.  

3. **Evolution Cards**  
   - Trigger when mutation conditions are met.  
   - Replace base creature with evolved form.  
   - Evolutions follow **structured trees** but gain **procedural traits**.  
   - Example: Grub + Spikes + Carapace → Beetle Warrior (with one of several random traits).  

4. **Spell / Action Cards**  
   - One-time effects (damage, buffs, healing, disruption).  
   - Often interact with mutation paths.  

5. **Environment Cards**  
   - Modify battlefield rules.  
   - Some evolutions adapt differently depending on environment.  
   - Example: *Lava Field* may turn Beetle Warrior into an *Ash Beetle*.

## **Gameplay Mechanics**
- **DNA Slots**: Define which mutations a creature can accept.  
- **Mutation Stack**: Mutations are permanent and build toward evolutions.  
- **Structured + Procedural Balance**:  
  - Structured = evolution tree + primary mutation effects.  
  - Procedural = secondary modifiers, environmental adaptations, hybrid fusions.  
- **Resource System**:  
  - *DNA Points* to mutate/evolve creatures.  
  - *Energy/Mana* to cast spells.  

---

## **Player Experience**
- **Strategic clarity**: Players can plan evolution paths through visible trees.  
- **Procedural uniqueness**: Each playthrough creates slightly different evolutions.  
- **Spectacle**: Creature art updates dynamically with every mutation and evolution.  

---

## **Example Flow**
1. Summon a **Grub** (1/3 stats, DNA slots: Body, Attack, Defense).  
2. Apply **Spikes** mutation (+2 Attack, Thorns). Procedural roll = *Poison Spikes*.  
3. Apply **Carapace** mutation (+3 Armor). DNA filled → evolve into **Beetle Warrior**.  
4. Procedural roll: Gains *Reinforced Armor* as an additional trait.  
5. Battlefield is *Lava Field* → Beetle Warrior adapts into **Ash Beetle**.

## **Win Conditions**
- **Board Domination**: Defeat opponent with evolved creatures.  
- **Genetic Overload**: Win by reaching a mutation threshold across your board.  
- **Environmental Mastery**: Outlast or adapt best to the current battlefield.  

---

## **Digital-Only Features**
- **Dynamic Art Layering**: Creatures visually change with every mutation.  
- **Procedural Hybrids**: Unique cards generated mid-match by mutation fusion.  
- **Adaptive Evolutions**: Creatures evolve differently based on survival in environments.
